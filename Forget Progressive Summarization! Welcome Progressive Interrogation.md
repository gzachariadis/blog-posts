Over three years ago at this point, I read my first self-help book, how it got in my hands still, I do not know. I suppose, I was frustrated with my situation, overwhelmed by school classes and freaked out at what was coming next, so I decided to seek some help, and as an introvert, my first idea was to visit a bookstore. 

Walking through those old wooden floors of a downtown Reading bookstore, I feel in love with books, an addiction soon followed and by the time I knew I was surrounded by 800 books, in boxes, in libraries, on desk, in cupboards in my kitchen. I vividly remember confusing the Uncle Ben's Box with the at the time no.1 best-seller The Subtle Art of Not Giving a Fuck, as I kept some books on the same shelf from lack of space. And there I was, bragging to my online friends about reading 100 books in a year, hoping they wouldn't ask the question..."What have you learned?" because honestly, I wouldn't know what to answer. I had a lot of facts in my head, maybe a few anecdotes and once in a while, a good concept to share, but my knowledge was like a card tower, after a few questions, it would tamble down. As [[dsdsd]] says in Tools of Titans, I was like the Nile, a mile wide, but an inch deep.

So, I decided to make a change, I sold most of my books (link blog post about mistake) and as a good addict, replaced some of them with books like [[How We learn]] and [[dasda]] (add books about learning how to learn) and I started my Journey through learning how to learn. Through this process (add link to blog post about process), I came across some youtube videos, which led me to the site of [[Tiago Forte]] and his famous [[Progressive Summarization]] method. I started experimenting with it for a while, around 6-7 months and along other techniques like [[add technique]] and [[[dads]] it proved the most useful. 

My problem with it thought, it was that is was so fast, I know I know, you are ready to close the tab now, but hear me out. I know most people are either busy or are after results, but if I learned something throught reading 100 books is that, results come from going deep and I had to go deep to fight my addiction. I had to be able to slow down my reading and give myself excuse to stop reading by working through a book and diving deeper. So that's what I did..and although the method I came up with lowered my output by substantial margins, I found myself, loving to talk about what I learned, remembering more and feeling more engaged and picky about the books I read.

So how does it work? Well, it's based on the same model, think of it like levels in a game, you have your highlights and they have to fight with the questions, you have to fight with the questions with them and get them to reach new levels.

### Level 1

- Put everything you have highlighted from the book
    - Quotes
    - Book Recommendations
    - Themes
    etc.
- Type of Highlight
- Why Should I care
- To be advanced?
- My Thoughts
- Similar Ideas --> Concepts Database --> Relation
- Clashes With --> Concepts Database --> Relation

### Level 2

- Themes
- Academic Research
- Practical Examples
- Advice
etc.
- Anything I deem useful and want to do something with. Work it further in my head and get something out of it.

On this level, I rephrase.
I try to force everything into a more practical framework
Generally, I am trying to understand how does this information help me. Why does it have value to me? In a vague but, more concrete level than the previous one, anything past this level must have some concrete evidence that somehow this can help me.

- How Does this Affect My Daily Life?
- How Would I Act Differently Knowing this?
- Applicabillity scale (if 5 then it advances to the next stage)
- Share it With

### Level 3

- Anything that passed through level 2 and convinced me

This level is where shit get real, where I put everything I have into buckets that help me get more concrete and practical, this is where the bullshit get dealt with. Where everything is put into my mind and must be transformed into plans that are actionable immediately.

- Where Can I apply? (Set for an area of my life. I can go as vague as Work or Fitness but my goals is to go as detailed as possible and set something like my Weights Workout Routine)
- How Can I Apply? (Is it already a concete action? if not, I must transform it in one, I must set up tools, research stuff and write a detailed plan of how am I going to implement this in my life. It could take a while to move from level 3 to 4 so I take my time to design a cost-effective experiment and try to implement it into my daily existence.)
- Why Would That Work? (I must give details, research data, sentiments, feelings, thoughts, anything I have to explain my point of view on the topic from the side of believing this will wokr)
- What could go wrong? (Do I fear setting exercise or write about it, find from the book what challenges other came up with, what's the wost case scenario? )
- Advance?

### Level 4

At this stage I have decided what I am going to use from this book and done my analysis of how I am gonna use it and that it's worth my time and effort. Now all I have to do is put it in my structure.

- Ask "How Should I Best Implement This?" to start thinking of the best way to test this ideas and how to design experiemnts to see what advancements I get from these points.
- Goal --> Relation? Think of a specific goal I have that this can help me achieve?

### Level 5?

- Experiment
- Duration
- Results

Level 6?

- In my experience level 6 should have around 5-10 notes in a medium value book.
- 15-20 for a book you will want to read again and you gained really high value out of it.

You can add as many questions as you want on each level, I suggest the most questions to be around level 2 or 3. I read once that when people were told to rate an experiemence from one to ten but couldn't rate it a 7, it made more people clearly choose between 6 and 8. That makes sense to me, it make the gap between a mediocre and a really good experience stick out like a sore thumb. Therefore, I suggest that those stages must be the harsher to distinguish the few key points you want to squeeze out of the book.

Another suggestion is to make each level question form a topic or an area, make the question on that level closely related to each other, it will make more sense to answer them together and it also builds your knowledge and thoughts on one area of a topic, make one level on practically, make another one on how does this knowledge change your thinking or understanding on a topic, go high level, low level, micro, macro. 

My last suggestion is to set aside time to do this without the internet and fully concentrate on your questions. if you are not someone that takes detailed notes on the book itself or write your thoughts on your highlights or even if you read paperback books, the first level will take a lot of your time, for me it take about 3-5 hours seperated in two-three days, depending on the book. The second and third level take equal amounts of time if not more...and the last levels, take less time, because by the time you reached there, you have thought and thought these things through many times and considered many different things. 

Hope that helped :)
