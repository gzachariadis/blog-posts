What's the ideal ratio?

1. Give yourself time between writing summaries and thoughts and actually taking time to write the post it notes. When you are bored and write by hand, its easier to get down to the most actionable and worth writing ideas.

1. Take a pencil and underline the action word of the sentence then at the end of the chapter come back to it and ask yourself if it make sense for you practically then transfer it to a computer if not, erase it.
