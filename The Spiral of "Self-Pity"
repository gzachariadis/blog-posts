# Self-pity is one of the most useless responses to life’s trials. Self-pity doesn’t change anything.

> This is problematic in two respects. One: blaming other people, especially your parents, has an expiry date. If you’re still holding your parents liable for your problems at the age of forty, then one can argue that you’re so immature you practically deserve them.

> Studies show that even undeniably awful childhood events (the death of a parent, divorce, neglect, sexual abuse) are minimally correlated with success or satisfaction in adult life.
 

> The former president of the American Psychological Association, Martin Seligman, analysed hundreds of these studies and concluded that “It has turned out to be difficult to find even small effects of childhood events on adult personality, and there is no evidence at all of large—to say nothing of determining—effects.” Far more decisive than our history are our genes—and their distribution is sheer chance.

There's no reason that I mention I was a "bullied kid" other than to make a correlation in my head and show the difference between where I was and where I am. Nothing that happened in my childhood has any effect on my life today. Now that might seem extreme to someone, surely if you lose your parents, you might have had to work for a living before, but life was fortunate with you. Yes, I was fortunate, but if you let problems like that affect you, years after the inception and effects have passed on, then you deserve them at some level.
